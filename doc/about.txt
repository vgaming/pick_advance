In multi-player game, you do not control unit advancements if they happen on enemy turn.
With this add-on, you can set them beforehand for:

* one exact unit
* all new units of same type in game
* all new units of same type in future games on a map. It stores your choice locally on the computer using wesnoth API. It's safe and doesn't/cannot work if you disable the add-on.
