In multiplayer game, you do not control unit advances if they happen on enemy turn.
With this add-on, you can set them beforehand for:

* one exact unit
* all new recruits


To add-on developers:
You can signal this add-on to force choosing upgrades for your map.
To do that, set the variable ''pickadvance_force_choice'' to true.
Alternatively, set empty recruit list for all human sides.
