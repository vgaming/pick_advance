In multi-player game, you can get unexpected unit advance if it happens on enemy turn.
With this add-on, you can set it beforehand, so you'll always get the advance you wanted.

This mod allows you specify advancement for:
* one exact unit
* all new units of same type in game
* all new units of same type on map (for future games). It works by storing your preferences locally on your computer. It's safe and uses public wesnoth API to do that. Does not and cannot work if you disable the add-on.

Note: the add-on overrides advancement choices to the ones available for the unit type.
It may be thus conflicting with other add-ons if they add additional advancement choices to units, but not to unit types.
