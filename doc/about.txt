Set unit advances before they happen.

In multi-player game, this may be your only option to pick a specific advance.
In single-player game, this may help you automate advances (see below).

This mod allows you specify advancement for:
* one exact unit
* all new units of same type in this game
* TODO: all new units of same type on this map (scenario)
* TODO: all new units of same type, globally for your wesnoth client (it is safe, works only while the mod is enabled)

Note: the add-on resets advancement choices to the ones available for the unit type.
It may be thus conflicting with other add-ons if they add additional advancement choices to units, but not to unit types.
