In multi-player game, you can get unexpected unit advance if it happens on enemy turn.
With this add-on, you can set it beforehand.

This mod allows you specify advancement for:
* one exact unit
* all new units of same type in game
* all new units of same type in future games on a map. It stores your choice locally on the computer using wesnoth API. It's safe and doesn't/cannot work if you disable the add-on.
