<<
In multi-player game, you can get unexpected unit advance if it happens on enemy turn.
With this add-on, you can set it beforehand, so you'll always get the advance you wanted.

This mod allows you specify advancement for:
* one exact unit
* all new units of same type in this game (for your side)

Note: the add-on resets advancement choices to the ones available for the unit type.
It may be thus conflicting with other add-ons if they add additional advancement choices to units, but not to unit types.
